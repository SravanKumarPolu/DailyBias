# Voice Settings Reset Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Reset Button Not Functional

The Reset button was missing `cursor-pointer` class, making it unclear it was clickable.

### 2. Wrong Default Speech Rate

The default speech rate was set to 1.0x but should be 0.9x for better listening experience.

## What Was Changed

### Default Speech Rate: 1.0x → 0.9x

Changed in **3 locations**:

#### 1. `hooks/use-settings.ts` (Initial Default)

```tsx
// Before
voiceRate: 1.0,

// After
voiceRate: 0.9,
```

#### 2. `app/settings/page.tsx` (State Initialization)

```tsx
// Before
const [localVoiceRate, setLocalVoiceRate] = useState(settings.voiceRate || 1.0)

// After
const [localVoiceRate, setLocalVoiceRate] = useState(settings.voiceRate || 0.9)
```

#### 3. `app/settings/page.tsx` (Reset Function)

```tsx
// Before
const handleResetVoiceSettings = async () => {
  setLocalVoiceRate(1.0)
  await saveSetting("voiceRate", 1.0)
  // ...
}

// After
const handleResetVoiceSettings = async () => {
  setLocalVoiceRate(0.9)
  await saveSetting("voiceRate", 0.9)
  // ...
}
```

### Reset Button Cursor

```tsx
// Before
<Button className="bg-transparent">
  <RotateCcw /> Reset
</Button>

// After
<Button className="bg-transparent cursor-pointer">
  <RotateCcw /> Reset
</Button>
```

## Voice Settings Defaults

| Setting         | Default Value | Range       | Purpose                                             |
| --------------- | ------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speech Rate** | **0.9x**      | 0.5x - 2.0x | Speaking speed (0.9x = slightly slower, more clear) |
| **Pitch**       | 1.0x          | 0.5x - 2.0x | Voice pitch (1.0x = normal)                         |
| **Voice**       | Daniel        | Various     | Preferred voice (high-quality voices prioritized)   |

## Why 0.9x Speech Rate?

**0.9x is 10% slower than normal** and provides:

✅ **Better Comprehension** - Easier to understand complex bias explanations  
✅ **More Natural** - Not too slow, not too fast  
✅ **Mobile Friendly** - Better for listening while multitasking  
✅ **Cognitive Load** - Easier to absorb information about biases

**Speed Comparison:**

- **0.5x** = Very slow (for language learning)
- **0.9x** = Slightly slower (clear and comfortable) ⭐ **Default**
- **1.0x** = Normal (standard reading pace)
- **1.5x** = Fast (for experienced users)
- **2.0x** = Very fast (speed readers)

## How Reset Works Now

2. Rate changes to 1.0x
3. Pitch changes to 1.0x
4. No clear visual feedback that it's clickable

2. Click Reset button
3. Rate changes to **0.9x** ✅
4. Pitch changes to 1.0x

## User Experience Improvements

### After

## Voice Feature Locations

The 0.9x speech rate is now used in:

1. **Settings Page** - Default value in sliders
2. **Reset Button** - Resets to 0.9x
3. **Bias Card "Listen" Button** - Reads at user's rate (default 0.9x)
4. **Voice Commands** - Reads at user's rate (default 0.9x)

## Related Settings

These work together for optimal voice experience:

```tsx
{
  voiceEnabled: true,        // Enable/disable voice features
  voiceRate: 0.9,           // Speed: 0.9x (default)
  voicePitch: 1.0,          // Pitch: 1.0x (normal)
  voiceName: "Daniel"       // High-quality voice
}
```
