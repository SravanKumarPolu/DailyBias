# Theme Icon Mapping - Synchronized ✅

## Consistent Icon System

Both the **header** and **settings page** now use the SAME icons for each theme mode.

### Icon Mapping

| Theme Mode | Icon | Location |
|------------|------|----------|
| **Light** | ☀️ Sun | Both header & settings |
| **Dark** | 🌙 Moon | Both header & settings |
| **System** | 🖥️ Monitor | Both header & settings |

### How It Works

**Settings Page (Radio Buttons):**
```tsx
Light   → ☀️ Sun icon
Dark    → 🌙 Moon icon  
System  → 🖥️ Monitor icon
```

**Header (Toggle Button):**
```tsx
Light   → ☀️ Sun icon (click to cycle to dark)
Dark    → 🌙 Moon icon (click to cycle to system)
System  → 🖥️ Monitor icon (click to cycle to light)
```

### User Experience

The header button shows the **CURRENT** theme (not the next one), which:
- ✅ Matches the selected radio button in settings
- ✅ Provides clear visual feedback of current state
- ✅ Click cycles through: Light → Dark → System → Light...
- ✅ Icons always synchronized between header and settings

### Visual Consistency

**Before fix:**
- Header showed "opposite" icons (confusing!)
- Light mode showed Moon 🌙 ❌
- Dark mode showed Sun ☀️ ❌

**After fix:**
- Header shows "current" icons (clear!)
- Light mode shows Sun ☀️ ✅
- Dark mode shows Moon 🌙 ✅
- System mode shows Monitor 🖥️ ✅

### Testing

1. **Open settings** → Select "Light" → See ☀️ Sun
2. **Check header** → Should also show ☀️ Sun
3. **Click header button** → Cycles to Dark → Shows 🌙 Moon
4. **Check settings** → "Dark" should be selected with 🌙 Moon
5. **Click again** → Cycles to System → Shows 🖥️ Monitor
6. **Check settings** → "System" should be selected with 🖥️ Monitor

✅ All icons now perfectly synchronized!
