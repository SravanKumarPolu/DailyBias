║              🎤 VOICE SELECTION FIX - COMPLETE! 🎤                           ║
║        Test Voice Now Uses the Voice You Actually Selected                   ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

🚨 THE PROBLEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ Selected "Samantha" → Test voice → Heard "System Default"
❌ Selected "Alex" → Test voice → Heard "System Default" 
❌ All voices sounded the same

WHY?
1. Settings hadn't updated in React state when you clicked Test
2. Browser was using cached/default voice
3. Language mismatch caused fallback to system voice

✅ THE FIX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Test button now reads dropdown value DIRECTLY from DOM
✅ Voice name passed EXPLICITLY to speak() function
✅ Utterance language matches voice language (no fallback)
✅ Pending speech cancelled before new utterance
✅ Voice name spoken in sample: "Hello. This is Samantha."
✅ Button shows "Testing..." state while playing

🎯 HOW TO USE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Go to Settings → Voice section
2. Click the Voice dropdown
3. Select a different voice (e.g., "Samantha", "Alex", "Victoria")
4. Click "Test voice" button
5. Listen → Should hear: "Hello. This is [Voice Name]." in that voice
6. Try different voices → Each should sound DIFFERENT

📱 PLATFORM EXPECTATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Desktop (macOS):     ✅ 20+ voices available, all different
Desktop (Windows):   ✅ 15+ voices available, all different
Android Chrome:      ✅ 10-20 voices available, all different
iOS Safari (web):    ⚠️  1-5 voices (iOS limitation)
iOS PWA (installed): ⚠️  1-2 voices (iOS restriction)

🔍 DEBUGGING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Check console when clicking Test voice:

✅ Good output:
   [Speech] Using selected voice: Samantha
   [Speech] Started speaking with voice: Samantha

❌ Problem output:
   [Speech] Using Daniel voice as fallback
   [Speech] No suitable voice found

Check available voices in console:
   window.speechSynthesis.getVoices().forEach(v => 
     console.log(v.name, v.lang)
   )
