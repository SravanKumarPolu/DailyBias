    "why": "Our brains have asymmetric information: we know our own context and pressures, but only see others' actions. This creates a systematic bias toward dispositional (character-based) explanations for others' behavior while favoring situational explanations for our own. The actor-observer asymmetry occurs because we have rich contextual information about our own behavior but only observe others' actions without their internal states, motivations, or circumstances.",
    "counter": "Before judging someone's actions, pause and ask: 'What circumstances might explain this behavior?' Assume good intent and consider external factors. When evaluating your own behavior, ask if you'd judge others the same way in similar circumstances. Practice perspective-taking by imagining the other person's situation and constraints.",
