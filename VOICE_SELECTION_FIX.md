# üé§ Voice Selection Fix - Complete Solution

## üö® Problem

**Issue**: When you select different voices and click "Test voice", you always hear the **same voice** (usually System Default), not the voice you selected.

**Why it happens**:

1. **Settings cache delay** - When you change the dropdown, it saves to IndexedDB, but React state (`settings.voiceName`) hasn't updated yet when you click Test
2. **Browser voice caching** - Some browsers (especially iOS/Safari) ignore voice changes if synthesis is already queued
3. **Language mismatch** - If `utterance.lang` doesn't match the voice's language, browsers silently fall back to system default
4. **iOS/PWA limitations** - Standalone PWAs on iOS may only expose 1-2 voices regardless of what's installed

---

## ‚úÖ Complete Fix Applied

### 1. **Direct Voice Override** (hooks/use-speech.ts)

Added ability to pass voice name directly to `speak()` function:

```typescript
// Before
speak(text) // Always uses settings.voiceName (might be stale)

// After
speak(text, "Samantha") // Uses specified voice immediately
```

**Changes**:

- `speak()` now accepts `overrideVoiceName?: string`
- `speakChunks()` now accepts `overrideVoiceName?: string`
- `selectBestVoice()` now accepts `overrideVoiceName?: string`

### 2. **Read from DOM** (app/settings/page.tsx)

Test button now reads the **current** dropdown value directly:

```typescript
const handleTestVoice = async () => {
  // Get current selection from DOM (bypasses React state delay)
  const selectElement = document.getElementById("voice-select")
  const selectedVoiceName = selectElement?.value || ""

  // Pass directly to speak function
  speak(sample, selectedVoiceName || undefined)
}
```

### 3. **Language Alignment** (hooks/use-speech.ts)

Set utterance language to match the voice:

```typescript
// Before
utterance.lang = "en-US" // Always US English
utterance.voice = selectedVoice

// After
if (selectedVoice) {
  utterance.lang = selectedVoice.lang // Match voice language!
  utterance.voice = selectedVoice
}
```

### 4. **Cancel Pending Speech** (hooks/use-speech.ts)

Cancel any pending synthesis before starting new utterance:

```typescript
// Cancel any pending utterances before speaking
if (window.speechSynthesis.speaking || window.speechSynthesis.pending) {
  window.speechSynthesis.cancel()
}
window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance)
```

### 5. **Voice Name in Sample** (app/settings/page.tsx)

Sample now says the voice name so you can confirm:

```typescript
const voiceLabel = selectedVoiceName || "System Default"
const sample = `Hello. This is ${voiceLabel}.`
```

## üß™ How to Test

### Desktop (Chrome/Edge)

1. Open Settings ‚Üí Voice
2. You should see multiple voices (Samantha, Alex, Victoria, etc.)
3. Select a different voice
4. Click **"Test voice"**
5. You should hear: "Hello. This is [Voice Name]." in that voice
6. Try different voices - each should sound different

### Mobile (iOS Safari)

1. Open Settings ‚Üí Voice
2. You might only see "System Default" (iOS limitation)
3. Click **"Refresh voices"** - might add 1-2 more voices
4. Select a voice
5. Click **"Test voice"**
6. Should hear that voice (if available on iOS)

**Note**: iOS in standalone PWA mode often limits voices to just the system default. This is an Apple platform restriction, not a bug in your app.

### Mobile (Android Chrome)

1. Open Settings ‚Üí Voice
2. Should see Google voices (en-US, en-GB, etc.)
3. Select different voices
4. Click **"Test voice"**
5. Should hear different voices

## üîç Debugging

### Check Console Logs

When you click "Test voice", look for:

```
[Speech] Using selected voice: Samantha
[Speech] Text split into 1 chunk(s)
[Speech] Speaking 1 chunk(s) with voice: Samantha
[Speech] Started speaking with voice: Samantha
```

If you see:

- `"Using Daniel voice as fallback"` - Your selected voice wasn't found
- `"Using any English voice"` - Falling back to default
- `"No suitable voice found"` - No voices available

### Check Available Voices

In browser console:

```javascript
// List all available voices
window.speechSynthesis.getVoices().forEach((v) => {
  console.log(v.name, v.lang, v.localService)
})
```

### Test Voice Directly

In browser console:

```javascript
// Force test a specific voice
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Test")
const voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()
utterance.voice = voices.find((v) => v.name === "Samantha")
utterance.lang = utterance.voice?.lang || "en-US"
window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance)
```

## üéØ What Should Happen Now

### When you select a voice and click "Test voice":

1. ‚úÖ Reads current dropdown value from DOM (bypasses React state)
2. ‚úÖ Ensures voices are loaded (iOS workaround)
3. ‚úÖ Finds the exact voice you selected
4. ‚úÖ Sets utterance language to match voice language
5. ‚úÖ Cancels any pending speech
6. ‚úÖ Speaks with the selected voice
7. ‚úÖ Says the voice name so you can confirm
8. ‚úÖ Auto-stops after 2.5 seconds
9. ‚úÖ Shows "Testing..." button state

**Result**: Each voice should sound **distinctly different**!

## üö® Platform Limitations

### iOS Safari / iOS PWA

- **Limited voices**: Often shows only "System Default" or 1-2 voices
- **Why**: Apple restricts Web Speech API in web apps
- **Workaround**:
  - Click "Refresh voices" after user interaction
  - Try opening in Safari (non-PWA) to compare
  - Install voices in iOS Settings ‚Üí Accessibility ‚Üí Spoken Content ‚Üí Voices

### Android Chrome

- **Good support**: Usually shows 10-20 Google voices
- **Should work**: Different voices should be clearly audible

### Desktop Browsers

- **Best support**: Chrome/Edge show many voices
- **macOS**: Samantha, Alex, Victoria, Daniel, Karen, etc.
- **Windows**: Microsoft David, Zira, Mark, etc.

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Always Test in Console First

```javascript
// In browser console
const voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()
console.log(`Found ${voices.length} voices:`)
voices.forEach((v, i) => console.log(`${i}: ${v.name} (${v.lang})`))
```

### 2. Verify Voice Object

```javascript
// In console after selecting a voice
const select = document.getElementById("voice-select")
console.log("Selected:", select.value)

const voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()
const voice = voices.find((v) => v.name === select.value)
console.log("Voice object:", voice)
```

### 3. Force Voice Loading (iOS)

```javascript
// In console - force iOS to load voices
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("")
window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance)
window.speechSynthesis.cancel()
// Then check voices again
window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

After deploying:

1. **Clear your cache** (important!)
2. **Open Settings ‚Üí Voice**
3. **Check console** - should see voice list logs
4. **Select "Samantha"** (if available)
5. **Click "Test voice"**
6. **Listen** - should hear female voice saying "Hello. This is Samantha."
7. **Select "Alex"** (if available)
8. **Click "Test voice"**
9. **Listen** - should hear male voice saying "Hello. This is Alex."

If all voices sound the same:

- Check console logs for which voice is actually being used
- Check if voices are actually available: `window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()`
- Try on a different device/browser
- iOS PWA users: Try in Safari browser first to verify

## üìä Expected Results

| Platform                     | Voices Available    | Will Test Button Work?    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Desktop Chrome (macOS)**   | 20+ voices          | ‚úÖ YES - Different voices |
| **Desktop Chrome (Windows)** | 15+ voices          | ‚úÖ YES - Different voices |

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Deploy the fix**:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/sravanpolu/Projects/DailyBias
   pnpm build
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

2. **Clear your cache** and test on:
   - Desktop browser
   - Mobile browser
   - PWA installed

3. **If still same voice**:
   - Open browser console
   - Run: `window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()`
   - Check how many voices you actually have
   - iOS might genuinely only have 1 voice available

---

**The fix is applied! Deploy and test with different voices.** üé§

If you have multiple voices available and they still sound the same after deployment, let me know and I'll add debug logging to trace exactly what's happening.
