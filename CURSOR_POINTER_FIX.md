# Cursor Pointer Fix - Interactive Elements

## Issue

Icons and interactive elements in the header and navigation were not showing a pointer cursor on hover, making it unclear they were clickable.

## What Was Fixed

Added `cursor-pointer` class to all interactive elements throughout the app for better UX.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Header Component (`components/daily-header.tsx`)

**Fixed Elements:**

- ✅ **Voice command button** (Mic icon)
- ✅ **Theme toggle button** (Sun/Moon/Monitor icons)
- ✅ **Settings button** (Bell icon)
- ✅ **"Daily Bias" logo link** (with hover effect)

**Code:**

```tsx
// All header buttons now have cursor-pointer
<Button className="touch-target cursor-pointer">
  <Icon className="h-5 w-5" />
</Button>

// Logo also has cursor and hover effect
<Link href="/" className="cursor-pointer">
  <h1 className="hover:opacity-80 transition-opacity">
    Daily Bias
  </h1>
</Link>
```

#### 2. Navigation Component (`components/navigation.tsx`)

**Fixed Elements:**

- ✅ All 5 navigation links (Daily, All, Favorites, Add, Settings)

**Code:**

```tsx
<Link href={item.href} className="cursor-pointer ...">
  <Icon />
  <span>{label}</span>
</Link>
```
